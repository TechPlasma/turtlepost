      I've always rather enjoyed reading and I had come across a bunch of these
      little libraries spread out in various places. I think the first ones
      I saw were up in Chicago when I was visiting famliy there. And when I
      moved to Oklahoma I happened across a great many of them here as well.
      I was enamored by the concept and I made it a personal goal to build one
      for my place.

      It was a fantastic project and I had a lot of fun doing it. And honestly
      it came out a lot better than I could have possibly imagined.
